wath'em is a Ruby script for quickly finding github repos you may find interesting.

Usage:
# Top ten repos
$ ruby watchem.rb myusername

# Display up to 20 repos
$ ruby watchem.rb mysusername 20

What is deemed to be interesting?
watch'em assumes that what people you follow find interesting is also interesting
for you. watch'em looks at the repositories the people you follow are watching,
and each repository gains 1 point for each time it occurs.

Note: watch'em calls the github API N+2 times:
 1 (people you are following) +
 1 (repos   you are watching) + 
 N (the number of people you are following).
